# kenaflow-task-demo-1

This is a demo about "How to create and monitor user tasks" in SharePoint with kenaflow.

This demo contains to Workflows.

The first workflow "Task Demo 1" monitors the "Workflow Item" list and creates tasks in the "Workflow Tasks" list after a new item was created in "Workflow Items". 

The second workflow "Task Demo 2" monitors the "Workflow Tasks" list and updates the "Workflow Items" list item, if the task was completed.

There is a "development-in-progress" screen cast video about this two workflows. If you want to see it than just register for vimeo.com, follow "kenaro" (https://vimeo.com/kenaro) and send me a message here. Than I will grant you access to the screen cast.
